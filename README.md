# ogame
This repository consists of implementation of formulas for online game Ogame.
For now implementation is far from being complete.
It is implemented in structural paradigm to keep it as fast as possible.
Requires c++20, only header file ogame.h is required for now.
*Tested with gcc version 10.2.1 20200723 (Red Hat 10.2.1-1) (GCC).*
More compatibility options will be available soon (official support for different compilers).
